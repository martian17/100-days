Aoi's spaceship failed to slow down before arriving at the destination.
Inability to go back to the known civilization is materialized as breaking train tracks.
Since the ship has been operating much longer than it's intended, it's half broken,
The ship is going near the speed of light, and it is almost physically impossible to send
help, that's why "no one comes" to her even if she screams for help.
Even if she could go back, the world as she knows will be unrecognizable since so much time
would have passed because of the time dilation.
This is also the reason that the night sky she sees from the window is unrecognizable, and that
"the star she can't go back to" is moving away from her.
She perceives herself as riding a night train, which is much easier on her mind than
recognizing the naked truth that she will never be able to go back to the world as she knows.
She instinctively hopes that the train takes her to "a town she doesn't know", which means
by slim chance she hopes that someone, some remote expedition or unknown civilization, will
somehow find her spaceship and rescue her.
